SimpleGoal is a goal that can be done only once.
When completed, it awards _points exactly one time.
It tracks completion status with a boolean _isComplete.
Overrides methods from the base Goal to implement its unique behavior.
Supports saving and loading its state including whether itâ€™s already completed.

Purpose: Represents a simple, one-time goal that can be completed only once.
Once completed, it awards points only once and then stays completed.
