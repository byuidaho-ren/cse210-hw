This class defines a "Listing" activity that encourages the user to reflect on positive aspects of their life by listing items related to a random prompt.

Constructor (ListingActivity):

Calls the constructor of the base Activity class with specific values for the name ("Listing") and description. This initializes the properties in the base class.

The prompt list is statically defined with several reflective questions to guide the userâ€™s listing.

RunActivity Method:

Clears the console (Console.Clear()).

Calls the StartActivity() method from the base class to prepare the activity by displaying the name, description, and prompting for a duration.

A random prompt is selected from the prompts list, and the prompt is displayed to the user (Console.WriteLine(prompt)).

The Pause(3) method is called to pause for 3 seconds, giving the user time to absorb the prompt.

The program then tells the user to start listing ("Start listing...").

It enters a while loop that continues as long as the current time is less than the calculated endTime (i.e., until the activity duration has passed).

Inside the loop, the program waits for the user to input items using Console.ReadLine(). If the input is not empty, it adds the item to a list called items.

After the activity duration is over, the number of items listed is printed: Console.WriteLine($"You listed {items.Count} items.");

Finally, it calls EndActivity() to finish the activity and display a completion message.

Pause(int seconds):

A method from the Activity class that pauses the program for a specified number of seconds (in this case, 3 seconds), creating a small delay between user actions.

The activity clears the console and starts by displaying a random prompt.

The user is given time to read the prompt, then they are encouraged to start listing.

The user types in their responses (e.g., names of people they appreciate or personal strengths), and the program collects these responses.

After the allotted time (based on user input), the program displays how many items the user listed and ends the activity.

Additional Notes:
Random Prompt Selection: The class randomly selects one of the predefined prompts to encourage reflection on various positive aspects of life.

User Input Handling: The program ensures that only non-empty inputs are added to the list of items, ignoring blank or empty responses.
